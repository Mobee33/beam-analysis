# Comprehensive Beam Analysis Tool üèóÔ∏è

## Overview

This web application provides a tool for visualizing and analyzing various beam loading and support conditions. Users can select from 32 different standard beam cases, adjust load parameters, and instantly see the corresponding:

*   **Visual representation of the beam, supports, and loads.**
*   **Shear Force Diagram (SFD).**
*   **Bending Moment Diagram (BMD).**
*   **Relevant governing equations.**

The tool is designed for students, engineers, and anyone interested in structural mechanics and beam theory.

## Features

*   **32 Standard Beam Cases:** Covers a wide range of configurations including:
    *   Simple Beams
    *   Cantilever Beams
    *   Overhanging Beams
    *   Propped Cantilevers
    *   Fixed-End Beams
    *   Continuous Beams (Two Spans)
*   **Interactive Parameter Adjustment:** Users can modify load magnitudes (P, w), lengths (‚Ñì, a, b, c), and other relevant parameters for each case.
*   **Dynamic Visuals:** An SVG-based diagram of the beam setup updates in real-time as parameters are changed.
*   **Shear Force and Bending Moment Diagrams:** Generated using Chart.js for clear and interactive plots.
*   **Equation Display:** Shows the key formulas used for calculating reactions, shear, and moment for the selected case.
*   **Modern & User-Friendly Interface:** Clean design for ease of use.
*   **Client-Side Calculation:** All calculations and rendering are done in the browser using JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** Structure of the web page.
*   **CSS3:** Styling and layout, including responsive design elements.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Core application logic, calculations, dynamic UI updates, and SVG manipulation.
*   **Chart.js:** For rendering interactive Shear Force and Bending Moment diagrams.
*   **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):** For drawing the beam, supports, and load visuals.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following key files:

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the application.
*   `styles.css`: Contains all the CSS rules for styling the application.
*   `beam_data.js`: A crucial JavaScript file holding the data objects for all 32 beam cases. This includes:
    *   Unique ID and title for each case.
    *   Definitions of adjustable parameters (name, label, default value, unit).
    *   Governing equations (as strings with HTML for formatting).
    *   `plotConfig` functions to calculate data points for SFD and BMD.
*   `beam_visualizer.js`: Contains JavaScript helper functions for drawing SVG elements and the specific visualizer functions for each of the 32 beam cases.
*   `main_app.js`: The main JavaScript file that ties everything together. It handles:
    *   UI initialization (populating dropdowns).
    *   Event listeners for user interactions.
    *   Dynamic generation of parameter input fields.
    *   Calling visualizer functions.
    *   Instantiating and updating Chart.js diagrams.
    *   Displaying equations.

## How to Run

1.  Clone this repository or download the files.
2.  Ensure all files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `beam_data.js`, `beam_visualizer.js`, `main_app.js`) are in the same directory.
3.  Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

No server-side setup is required as this is a purely client-side application.

## Usage

1.  **Select a Beam Condition:** Choose one of the 32 beam types from the dropdown menu.
2.  **Adjust Load Parameters:** Input fields for the relevant loads and dimensions for the selected beam will appear. Modify these values as needed.
3.  **Update:** Click the "Update Diagrams & Visual" button.
4.  **View Results:**
    *   The visual representation of the beam will update.
    *   The Shear Force Diagram (SFD) and Bending Moment Diagram (BMD) will be re-plotted.
    *   The relevant equations for the selected case will be displayed.

## Notes on Diagrams

*   **Shear Force Diagrams (SFD):** Plotted according to standard conventions.
*   **Bending Moment Diagrams (BMD):**
    *   For simple beams, cantilevers, and overhanging beams (approx. Figures 1-22), the moment diagrams are plotted "inverted" relative to some textbook conventions (e.g., sagging moments might be shown as negative). This was an initial design choice.
    *   For fixed-end and continuous beams (approx. Figures 23-32), the moment diagrams adhere to the standard structural engineering sign convention where hogging moments (typically at fixed ends or over intermediate supports) are plotted as negative.

## Future Enhancements (Potential)

*   Interactive dragging of loads/supports on the visual diagram.
*   Calculation and display of deflections.
*   Export options for diagrams (e.g., as PNG).
*   Unit selection (e.g., metric/imperial).
*   More detailed error handling and input validation.
*   Support for additional beam types or loading conditions.
